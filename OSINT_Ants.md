Antennae...ants...same thing right? 
This will be an open source research into all things antennas. 
Since I busted my new shiny antenna and just had to fix it I tested it and it worked. But I started to question that the test of just plugging it in and it working didn't satisfy me, why did it work and how? How can I measure its effectiveness, range, efficiency, how can I make it better or "hack" it to manipulate it. Something so tiny as an antenna made my brain itch.
