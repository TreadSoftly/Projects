## PLEASE BE PATIENT BEFORE I POST TO THIS DIRECTORY. I AM CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH AND SANITIZING MY USE CASES OF THE TARGETS SO I CAN POST THE USE CASES WITH THE TOOLS IN A SAFER WAY


I will be covering some OSINT work involving files of sanctioned targets I was tasked with conducting reconaisance on.
Names and other PIID will be removed. This is purely to show the use cases of the OSINT tools I have used and devoled. 

Tools involved include:
- TheHarvester
- SpiderPhoot
- Maltigo
- etc...
