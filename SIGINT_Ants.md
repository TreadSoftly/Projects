This will be an open-source research journey into all things antennas. After busting my new shiny antenna and managing to fix it, I was left pondering. The simple 'plug and test' method showed it worked, but why? How can I evaluate its performance metrics like effectiveness, range, and efficiency? Is there any way to manipulate these?

(The 'cantenna' scene from mr.ROBOT has a good example although alittle more technical know how goes into the proper construction of one)

## Undressing the casing of the antenna

## Tools used to get the casing off

I employed a hair dryer to loosen the heat-fitted end cap. It's a neat trick; the hair dryer doesn't get hot enough to cause damage, but it does soften the plastic just enough.

## Exposed (Post Fixed) - Wire came free/loosened from the traces

Cold solder fixed it. Why did it work again? How can we measure its functionality beyond the simple 'plug and play'?

## Size Matters in dBi and shielding
