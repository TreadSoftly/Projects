# Antennae...ants...same thing, right?

This will be an open-source research into all things antennas. Since I busted my new shiny antenna and just had to fix it, I tested it, and it worked. But I started to question that the test of just plugging it in and it working didn't satisfy me. Why did it work, and how? How can I measure its effectiveness, range, efficiency, how can I make it better or "hack" it to manipulate it? Something so tiny as an antenna made my brain itch.

## Exposed (Post Fixed) - Wire came free/loosened from the traces

Cold solder and plugged back in and worked. I want to know why it works again and how to measure instead of just plug and play.
