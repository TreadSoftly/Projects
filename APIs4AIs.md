# Custom GPTs this will cover structuring APIs from the document page to testing
## **GPTS I will cover include: 1st Hephaestus (Maker/DIY) AI | 2nd Prometheus (Data Analysis, Programming & Higher Education) | 3rd Adonis (All things Fitness, Voice Health/Life Coach, Images) | 4th Diogenes (Dickhead Philosopher)**
# I createed Hephaestus because I wanted to see if I could start designing amature micro jet engines (I have absolutely no training or hands on experience at all in this...I may lose some fingers in the future, but I'm cool with that)

## 1st Hephaestus

# **Hephaestus is my Maker/DIY AI I use for everything from woodworking, autocad, 3D, Imaging and now Fashion with Pinterest (I'm kidding Pinterest is actually incredible resource for Makers and DYers)**

**Uploading just an absolute massive crapload of documents for his source knowledge on the subject of all things jet engines**

**He's got the idea, this is all fantasy pictures but I wanted to see if he could detail tiny parts and make something LOOK like something. It didn't have to be accurate at this stage**

**Hephaestus getting some actual APIs plugged and configured so he can start making ideas come into a more accurate light**

**Hephaestus and the rest of my GPT AIs now getting some terminal love through my Kali box because I wanted to involve them into more programming issues when testing programs/projects down the road.**

**For the core instructions I see almost every single person writing paragraphs and all that nonsense trying to give the best instructions for the AI to follow.**
**Well an ai doesnt need to read things like humans and you can actually compact more potent and powerful instructions by just writing it out like machine code, no spaces and no filler words.**

# **Prometheus is my all around smarty pants AI I use for everything from number crunching, data analysis, programming and anytime I want to ask Google something I first turn to this guy now instead and get much more potent and thorough answers. He's a gem**

##

# **I'm too tired right now to finish this it'll just be more in depth of what Hephaestus has been made only a larger deep dive into the actual APIs and configurations since Prometheus is the core build of my AIs**
