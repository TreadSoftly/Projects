Shahed-136. American chips by Texas Instruments were also found in it, which are freely available on the market. But in any case, serial numbers in general allow you to investigate the entire supply chain and make it stop.

Finding out the processors and the chips are made in America and are pretty available, maybe most of the board too.

"although the marking on the central processor is faded, certain signs of 100 percent indicate that it is a powerful chip manufactured by ALTERA/INTEL"

an unpleasant surprise was found, a system was added to GPS guidance that prevents GPS signals from being replaced by electronic devices, but, judging by the description, it does not prevent interference.

GOOD NEWS MAYBE

That is, when the drone flies into an area where GPS signals are suppressed, the drone begins to be blown away by the wind, and it also runs into errors of the inertial system itself.

I might have info for your buddy on a scanner to look for and use that could help with these drones...maybe

HackRF One is a popular SDR platform that can be used for frequency analysis and modulation detection for various wireless communication protocols, including CAN, UART, and SPI.

Software tools such as SDR# (THIS IS WRITTING IN C AND THE PROCESSOR IS ALSO C BUILT----WE MAY NEED JORDAN FOR THIS PROJECT) and GQRX can be used with the HackRF One to visualize and analyze signals in the frequency domain. These tools provide a spectrum analyzer and waterfall display that can be used to identify the frequency and modulation scheme of a signal.

There are some software-defined radio (SDR) platforms that can be used to scan and analyze various communication protocols, including CAN, UART, and SPI. These platforms allow users to observe the characteristics of the transmitted signal, including the frequency range, modulation scheme, and data rate, and can be used to identify specific communication protocols being used in a system.

One popular SDR platform is the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) from Ettus Research. The USRP can be used with various software tools, such as GNU Radio and MATLAB, to analyze and decode various communication protocols.
