This will be an open source research into the known characteristics of rf, audio, and other signals from drones and other unmanned aerial systems
Cloaking and encryption of frequencies is becoming more prevalent but through a layered approach we can gain a foothold into pilfering of the signals to detection and possible options afterwards.
