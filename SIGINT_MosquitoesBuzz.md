# This will be an open source research into the known characteristics of rf, audio, and other signals from drones and other UAS

Cloaking and encryption of frequencies is becoming more prevalent but through a layered approach we can gain a foothold into pilfering of the signals to detection and possible options afterwards.

**A little build to try and capture signals with a panda usb device for intercepting and packet injection (you'll have to do your own research for this device since it is primarily used for "ethical" hacking) and a RODE mic for acustic listening**

Forgive me for not having my HackRF One device as I have let a friend borrow it for their Cyber Security Degree they are currently pursuing, also they are pricey as hell and I'm not about to go pick one up for a demonstration.

*Scrappy multi layered signal detection and analysis*
