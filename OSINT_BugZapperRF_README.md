## Introduction üéØ

This script utilizes the powerful Scapy library to perform network packet interception and injection, with a focus on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) traffic for ethical hacking purposes.

### Features:
- Advanced logging for monitoring and debugging.
- Environment variable support for enhanced flexibility.
- Threading for asynchronous packet interception.
- Packet injection for command and control.

## Script Breakdown üîç

### Logging and Configuration
```python
import logging

# Enhance logging for better debugging and monitoring
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
Main Classes and Methods
python
Copy code
import threading
from scapy.all import *

# Main interception thread class
class InterceptThread(threading.Thread):
    # Initialization and packet interception methods
    # ...
    
    # Command injection method
    def inject_cmd(self, cmd):
        # ...
Execution Flow
python
Copy code
def main():
    # Start the interception thread and wait for UAV traffic
    # ...
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
Usage Guide üõ†Ô∏è
Set up your environment with the necessary Python packages and network tools.
Configure your network interface in monitoring mode.
Run the script and follow the prompts to interact with UAV traffic.
