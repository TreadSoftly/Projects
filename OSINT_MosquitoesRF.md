COUNTER RF & SIGINT AI/LM RESEARCH/LABS (messy repo for now)






Basically this is PaperPlanes in depth. The damned noise of the mosquito irritates me about as much as hearing those damned drones overhead when I was on patrol in country. 
Instantly hate the sound/noise/frequencies and want to take them out. So lets build some things to do just that...for the drones of course, Bill Gates is the one working on the mosquitoes still.

Referencing my AnotherRaspberryPiBuild Repo will show a very similar pi build to the one below with similar components and links.
