## The noise of mosquitoes irritates me about as much as hearing drones overhead when I was on patrol in country. 
(Was it a good guy drone? Was it a bad guy drone? Who knows, cross your fingers!) 
I have always instantly hated the sound/noise/frequencies and want to take them down. 
So lets build some things to do just that...for the drones of course, Bill Gates is the one working on the mosquitoes still.
