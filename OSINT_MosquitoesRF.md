## Basically this is PaperPlanes in depth. The damned noise of mosquitoes irritates me about as much as hearing those damned drones overhead when I was on patrol in country. 
I have always instantly hated the sound/noise/frequencies and want to take them out. So lets build some things to do just that...for the drones of course, Bill Gates is the one working on the mosquitoes still.
