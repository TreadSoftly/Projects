## The noise of mosquitoes irritates me about as much as hearing drones overhead when I was on patrol in country. 
(Was it a good guy drone? Was it a bad guy drone? Who knows, cross your fingers!)

I have always instantly hated the sound/noise/frequencies and want to take them down. 
So let's build some things to do just that...for the drones of course, Bill Gates is the one working on the mosquitoes still.
(FOR NOW this will be a resource dump until I can organize this repo into a well laid out document)
