COUNTER RF & SIGINT AI/LM RESEARCH/LABS 
(messy repo for now)






Basically this is PaperPlanes in depth. The damned noise of the mosquito irritates me about as much as hearing those damned drones overhead when I was on patrol in country. 
Instantly hate the sound/noise/frequencies and want to take them out. So lets build some things to do just that...for the drones of course, Bill Gates is the one working on the mosquitoes still.

DJI more advanced hardware and software drones paired with updated resources. 
(Contractors mentioned seeing newer drones in the field and concerned with updates or outdated tech)
