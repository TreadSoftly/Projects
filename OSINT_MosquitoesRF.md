# COUNTER RF & SIGINT AI/LM RESEARCH/LABS

Welcome to the Counter RF & SIGINT AI/LM Research/Labs - a collaborative hub dedicated to advancing knowledge and technology in counter-drone strategies and signal intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities. Inspired by the urgent need to address the proliferation of drones and the nuisances they represent, this repository aims to be your premier destination for cutting-edge research, comprehensive guides, and practical applications in the realm of counter RF and SIGINT.

## About

Driven by the relentless buzz of drones overhead - reminiscent of the annoyance of mosquitoes but with far greater implications for privacy and security - we're here to develop solutions. Our mission is to dissect and counteract the frequencies and technologies that power these aerial intruders. From hobbyist drones to more advanced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), our focus is on demystifying their operations and empowering the community with the knowledge and tools to counteract.

## Starter Guide

While currently under organization, this section aims to provide a quick launchpad for engaging with our projects and understanding the core components and configurations essential to our research. For an in-depth understanding, please refer to our comprehensive Raspberry Pi build guide, which serves as a cornerstone for many of our projects.
